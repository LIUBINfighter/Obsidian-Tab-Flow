## Disclaimer

Please make a backup for your gp files. Some tabs rendered with bad results because of the different encoding methods for Chinese/Japanese/... characters.

This plugin can't automatically download `font`, `soundfont` and `worker.mjs` for you due to obsidian's policy about community plugins. However, we provide a bottom to complete the settings.
